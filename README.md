# :car: What the Park :blue_car:
'__What the Park__' is a web service that automatically recognizes license plates to manage parking lots.

<br>

## :mag: Outline
- There are many management services for official parking lots, but there is no one-time service for simple parking lots. Accordingly, the parking lot manager writes and manages the vehicle's entry and departure information manually. We developed the service to solve these inconveniences. <br>
- For the service, the vehicle number recognition API was developed and the parking lot status page was developed for the user to manage through vehicle information. <br>
- We expect that you can manage the parking lot conveniently through our service in a simple parking lot without parking facilities.
